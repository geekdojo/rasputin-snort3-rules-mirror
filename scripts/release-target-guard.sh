# release-target-guard.sh REMOTE TAG BUILT_SHA
#
# Proves a release tag points at the commit the release was built from.
#
# A release job builds the commit it checked out, but `gh release create TAG`
# creates a missing TAG on whatever the default branch points at when it runs,
# unless it is given --target. A PR merged during the build then leaves the tag
# on a commit the artifacts were never built from. The release jobs pass
# --target; this guard is the tripwire that fails the job if a tag still ends up
# anywhere else (a regression, or a tag that already existed on another commit).
#
# Reads the tag from REMOTE with `git ls-remote`, so it checks what everyone else
# sees rather than a local ref. Annotated tags are peeled to their commit. REMOTE
# is a URL or a path; for an https URL, `gh` supplies the credentials (GH_TOKEN
# in Actions), so nothing is written to .git/config.
#
# Exit status:
#   0  TAG exists on REMOTE and points at BUILT_SHA
#   1  TAG exists on REMOTE and points at a different commit (both SHAs printed)
#   2  usage error, or REMOTE could not be read (never reported as "absent")
#   3  TAG does not exist on REMOTE
#
# Run before creating a release to refuse a tag that already sits on another
# commit (1), and after creating it to prove where it landed (anything but 0 is
# a failure). tests/release-target-guard.test.sh covers every status.
